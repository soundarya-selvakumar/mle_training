4.	Create a new branch (enh/<issue-id>/<short-msg>) and copy the code-snippet here and commit as-is including the README. Use appropriate commit messages as per the guidelines.

5.	Add a .gitignore file to the repository to avoid committing unnecessary files like pyc files and the CSV data files in your current folder.
